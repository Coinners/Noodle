        <h3 id="What_is">1. What is Computer Science</h3>
        <p>Computer science is the study of computers and computing technologies, including both hardware and software. It
        encompasses the design, development, and application of computing systems, as well as their theoretical foundations.
        Computer science is a vast field that encompasses several sub-disciplines, including computer graphics, artificial
        intelligence, robotics, and more.</p>
        <h3 id="Programming">2. Programming</h3>
        <p>One of the most critical aspects of computer science is programming. Programming involves creating software using
        programming languages such as Python, C++, Java, and more. These languages are used to instruct a computer to perform
        specific tasks or calculations. As a beginner, you'll need to learn one or more programming languages and gain
        experience in writing code.</p>
        <h3 id="Algorithms">3. Algorithms and Data Structures</h3>
        <p>In computer science, algorithms are a set of instructions used to solve a problem or perform a task. They are used in
        software development to create efficient and effective solutions to various problems. Algorithms can be designed using a
        range of techniques, including sorting, searching, and graph traversal. Additionally, data structures are used to
        organize and store data, making it more accessible and easier to manipulate. Examples of data structures include arrays,
        lists, and trees.</p>
        <h3 id="Computer_Organization">4. Computer Organization</h3>
        <p>Another essential aspect of computer science is computer organization, which involves understanding how computers are
        built and operate. This includes learning about computer hardware components such as the CPU, memory, and storage
        devices. You'll also need to gain knowledge of how these components interact with each other to perform tasks.</p>
        <h3 id="Software">5. Software Engineering</h3>
        <p>Software engineering is the process of designing, creating, testing, and maintaining software. It involves applying
        engineering principles to the development of software systems. As a beginner, you'll need to learn about software
        engineering concepts such as project management, software testing, and software development methodologies.</p>
        <p>In summary, computer science is a vast and fascinating field that encompasses several sub-disciplines. As a beginner,
        it's essential to start with the basics, including programming, algorithms and data structures, computer organization,
        and software engineering. With dedication and effort, you can learn the fundamentals of computer science and build a
        strong foundation for a career in this exciting field.</p>
